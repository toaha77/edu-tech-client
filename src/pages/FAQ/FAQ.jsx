  How can I join a study room?
  </div>
  <div className="collapse-content"> 
    <p>You currently only need a Zoom account to be able to join our study rooms. Simply click on the button on our website or here and enter your Zoom credentials. You will then be taken to the Zoom app directly or you can join our room via your browser. (it might be that you have some functionality missing by joining from your browser though).

Once in the study room, you can change your name, the layout on how to see the other learners and decide if you would like to share your video via webcam). Thats it! You can now start to study.</p>
